todo-app-ruby
=============

Basic todo application using RoR and TDD to practice some TDD


Lessons learned:
* Incremental development flows so easily with TDD!
* My code remains tight and on-task when I focus on passing tests
* My code is sparsely commented, compared with how much I comment usually - is
  this good or bad? I'm not sure
* View testing is the hardest - user interaction doesn't always conform to an
  easy standard
* It is quite easy to get lost in implementing a complex feature and to begin
  deviating from passing the test to adding related (but yet untested) code
